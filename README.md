# RevolutionCore [1.7]

RevolutionCore is an in-progress, full fledge, HCFCore plugin for Minecraft 1.7.
I will update this page with its current code once or twice a week until the release which will probably happen around January of 2018.  

I am currently working on Base Commands, then I will move on to the complex command framework (Commands with multiple args).
  
 The projected final price of a compiled jar is $40.00.
